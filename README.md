# NumPad
Custom made numpad lib built upon SN74147 BCD converter. 

This lib is not for public use unless you have the exact same schematic, but it is enough to give the idea of it's functionality. Although simple, the whole code was written based on hardware which is not standardised and was hand soldered. Numpad functionality was coded for STM32F746ZG. IDE: ide.mbed.com/compiler
